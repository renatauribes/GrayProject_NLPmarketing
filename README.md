# Marketing Program Classification Code Repository
This repository contains the code for the Marketing Program Classification project. The project aims to automate the classification of marketing programs using NLP techniques and other analysis methods. The code is organized into several modules for different stages of the project.

## File Structure
Data Understanding: This file contains scripts and notebooks for data exploration and understanding including visualization. 

Wordclouds: This file contains code for generating word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in different program categories. It uses the cleaned and tokenized data to create word clouds for each category.

Cleaning: The cleaning folder includes scripts and functions for data cleaning and preprocessing. It covers tasks such as removing stopwords, lemmatization, and handling with special characters.

Models: This folder contains the code for training and evaluating the classification models. It includes scripts for feature extraction, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation with cross validation. Different models, such as K nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, and SVC, are implemented.

Topological Data Analysis: This folder includes code for performing topological data analysis on the marketing program data. It explores the relationships and patterns in the data using techniques like persistent homology and Mapper algorithm.
